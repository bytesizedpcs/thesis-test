#Things I would change

1. The wording under the main header could be viewed as disparaging to some people under a certain context. Should ask if it's completely necessary.
2. When having an account creation form, there should be a confirmation input for user's passwords.
3. Change ToS agreement to "By clicking 'Sign Up' *you* agree to our Terms of Service".
